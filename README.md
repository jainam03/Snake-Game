# Snake-Game

# Its just a simple game which almost every youngster must have played in his/her childhood in old models of mobile phones

# I've just created this for fun. (SOMETIMES WHILE RUNNING IT IN VS CODE IT DIRECTLY SHOWED ME GAMEOVER, BUT IT RAN PROPERLY WHEN I USED THE DEBUGGER)

# Credits goes to BroCode channel of YouTube, I learned it from there. So, thank you Bro

# Also if ur running this code in VSCode then run the code through debugger only otherwise you'll only be able to see Game Over message in the GUI window. I am working to solve this problem.
